# multiplayer RPS (rock, paper, scissors) game simulations
This python script calculates the expected number of rounds required to find a winner from
an RPS game of (a user inputted) n players. It then runs an inputted number of simulations and reports
back the mean number of rounds required.

### Motivations
I used to play multiplayer RPS often, to find a single/multiple winner(s)/loser(s) in a variety
of situations. (If you've never played with > 2 players before, maybe have a brief think 
about how the game works with more players, w.r.t. draws/stalemates). The game can go on a while with
lots of players (I must've played with around 12 people before), and I was interested to know
the average number of rounds required to find a winner. I worked it out mathematically and 
then made this script to test the result I had derived.

### Planned Improvements
- add mathematical reasoning to README
- make (2-player) RPS robot
- simulate multiplayer RPS game for (exciting??!) random picking app (cf. tap roulette)

### Collaboration
Any contributions/comments are welcome!
